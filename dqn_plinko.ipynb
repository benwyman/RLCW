    "#### Motivation: \n",
    ">The original Plinko code uses standard Q-learning. Q-learning is known for maximization bias, leading to overestimation of action values. Our standard Q-learning algorithm uses one Q-table to select both the best next action and to evaluate the value of that action. If some action's value is overestimated our max operation will likely select it therefore distributing the overestimation. Double Q-learning ensures that our selection and evaluation are separate. We will use the online Q-table to select the best next action while using the target Q-table to evaluate the value of that chosen action. This will reduce the chance of consistently selecting actions based on overestimated values."

    "#### Expectation: \n",
    ">We expect more accurate Q-value estimates, which will hopefully result in a more stable learning process and convergence to a better final policy to ensure a higher success rate for the target bucket. It might also prevent our agent from getting stuck favouring sub-optimal paths due to early overestimations."
